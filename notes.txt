"make pack" will pack up the module into ../cpviz.tgz so you can
upload it.

Next task: figure out who to do the database queries that are in
the perl version.  Maybe use $astman->database_show() instead
of mysql queries?

Used this PHP library to build the graph in PHP:
https://github.com/alexandresalome/graphviz

Used viz.js to render the graph into SVG:
https://github.com/mdaines/viz.js


There is a d3.js library for graphviz, at https://github.com/magjac/d3-graphviz
It actually uses viz.js to render the graph into SVG, then converts
that into a native d3 data representation, which you can then
manipulate like you would any other d3 data.  The main advantage
that I can think of is you could do animations, but that's really
not needed for this application.  It's possible you could more
easily make it interractive (like with popups to show you the times
associated with a Time Condition), so I might look into it for that
later.  But for now, just sticking with viz.js.
